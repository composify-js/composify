# Unblock your team [Empower non-developers to build and ship.]

In many teams, small UI changes still end up in the engineering queue — adjusting text alignment, swapping an image, or updating CTA copy for the umpteenth time.

With Composify, engineers focus on building and exposing reusable components. Then, non-developers — marketers, designers, content editors, PMs — use the visual editor to:

- Drag and drop components to build or rearrange a page
- Update copy, images, or other assets without code
- Tweak layouts while staying within the design system

This unlocks true collaboration across teams:

- Designers don't need to wait for developer availability
- Marketers can publish changes without opening a ticket
- Engineers stay focused on core features, not shipping pixels

From quick experiments to live product surfaces, each team can work in parallel and ship faster without stepping on each other's toes.
