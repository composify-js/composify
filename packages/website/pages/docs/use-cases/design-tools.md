# Design Tools [that stay true to production]

Design tools are great. But they often diverge from what's actually implemented.

With Composify, the design canvas uses the exact components from your production code, not lookalikes. Designers don't work with abstract components or static mockups. They work with the exact components used in production.

This means:

- Zero ambiguity between design and development
- Enforced consistency â€” if it's not in the system, it can't be used
- Creative freedom within clear boundaries

And when something new is needed? Designers request the component, engineers ship it, and it's instantly available in the editor.

Composify is not just another visual tool. It's a governed playground built on top of your actual UI stack. Design with the same system your users see.
