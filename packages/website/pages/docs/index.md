# Introduction [What is Composify?]

Composify is an open-source Server-Driven UI (SDUI) library that combines a lightweight JSX renderer with a visual editor, both powered by _your_ actual components.

In plain English: it's a WYSIWYG editor, but instead of some generic widget set, it uses your production components.

You build components, and Composify lets anyone on your team visually compose pages with them. That means faster iteration, fewer bottlenecks, and a massive productivity boost for everyone.

Under the hood, Composify takes a plain JSX string and renders it exactly as React would, so what you see in the editor is exactly what ships. No rewrites, no custom DSLs, no weird APIs.
