# Headless CMS [Use your own components, not templates]

Traditional CMSs like WordPress are powerful, but they lock you into their ecosystem of themes and plugins. Your components can't be used, forcing you to rebuild UIs with clunky page builders or outdated templates.

With Composify, you stop fighting your CMS and put your own component library at the center of the content experience. The visual editor is powered by your actual production components, not a restrictive theme.

This allows you to:

- Use the exact same components for marketing pages as you do for your core product.
- Empower content and marketing teams to build visually, without being limited by pre-made templates.
- Ensure what you edit is exactly what ships, eliminating the gap between your CMS and your production app.

It's the flexibility of a CMS, but with the power and consistency of your own design system. Stop rebuilding. Start composing.
