# Unblock your team [Empower non-developers to build and ship.]

In most companies, small UI tweaks, like adjusting text alignment or swapping an image, end up in the engineering backlog. This creates a bottleneck for everyone.

With Composify, the roles become clear:

- **Engineers** focus on what they do best: building robust, reusable components.
- **Non-developers**—marketers, designers, content editors, PMs—use the visual editor to bring those components to life.

This unlocks a new, truly collaborative workflow where anyone can:

- Drag and drop components to build or rearrange a page
- Update copy, images, or other assets without writing code
- Tweak layouts while staying safely within the design system

The result? Designers don't have to wait for developers. Marketers can publish changes without opening a ticket. And engineers can stay focused on core features, not just shipping pixels.
