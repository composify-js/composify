# Design Tools [A design tool that's always in sync]

Design tools are great, but they have a classic problem: they drift out of sync with what's actually in production.

With Composify, your design canvas *is* your production code. Designers don't work with static mockups or lookalike components; they build with the exact same components your users see.

This means:

- **Zero drift** between design and development
- **Guaranteed consistency**â€”if a component isn't in the system, it can't be used
- **Creative freedom** within clear, established boundaries

When a new component is needed, the workflow is simple: designers request it, engineers build and register it, and it instantly becomes available for use in the editor.

Composify isn't just another visual tool. It's a governed playground built on your actual UI stack. Stop designing with replicas. **Start designing with the real thing.**
