# No code tools [For content & marketing teams]

Not every UI change needs to be a product feature. Marketing needs to launch a promotion. Content editors want to tweak a landing page. The ops team might be running a seasonal campaign.

With Composify, you can empower these teams to:

- Build campaign pages from pre-defined component blocks
- Edit text, images, and layouts visually, without touching code
- Publish changes instantly, without waiting on a developer

Common use cases include:

- Promotional or campaign landing pages
- Regional or seasonal UI variations
- Blog-style layouts built with dynamic components

Instead of building a custom CMS or burning engineering hours on small tweaks, you can give other teams the power to ship on their ownâ€”all while using the same components and design system as the core product.
