# No code tools [For non-developers]

Not every UI change comes from the product team. Marketing might need to launch a promotion. Content editors may want to adjust a landing page. Ops could be running a localized campaign or seasonal theme.

With Composify, they can:

- Build campaign pages from pre-defined blocks
- Edit text, images, and layout visually, without coding
- Publish changes instantly, without waiting for a deploy

Common use cases:

- Promotional or campaign landing pages
- Regional or seasonal variations
- Blog-like longform layouts using real components

Instead of building custom CMSs or burning engineering time on small changes, you can let other teams ship on their own â€” using the same components, design system, and visual editor as the rest of the product.
