# A/B testing and prototyping [Prototype and iterate faster]

A/B testing isn't just about changing button colors anymore. With Composify, you can test entirely different UI variations, without touching client code.

You could:

- Swap out whole page structures
- Show/hide modules (e.g. a referral banner for active users only)
- Try different CTAs, images, or copy for different segments
- Personalize onboarding flows based on user behavior

All of it is configured from your backend. Assign layouts to experiment groups, gate them with feature flags, track performance â€” all without a single redeploy.

This also unlocks another powerful use case: lightweight prototyping. Say you have an idea for a new upsell screen, a referral flow, or a product announcement. You want to test it in the real app, not in Figma.

With Composify you can:

- Build prototypes with real, production components
- Skip branches, PRs, and deployments. Just compose visually
- Launch, validate, iterate, or scrap it. All without engineering bottlenecks

This makes Composify especially useful for:

- Growth experiments
- Internal tools
- MVPs that need fast feedback from real users

Some teams even treat SDUI surfaces as live prototypes. They test and tune layouts continuously, then "lock them in" once they're validated.
