# A/B testing and prototyping [Prototype and iterate faster]

A/B testing is more than just changing button colors. With Composify, you can test entirely different UI variations without touching client-side code.

You could:

- Swap out entire page structures for different user segments
- Show or hide modules (e.g., a referral banner for active users only)
- Test different CTAs, images, or copy
- Personalize onboarding flows based on user behavior

All of this can be configured on your backend. Assign layouts to experiment groups, gate them with feature flags, and track performance—all without a single redeploy.

This also unlocks rapid, high-fidelity prototyping. Have an idea for a new feature? You can test it in the real app, not just in Figma.

With Composify, you can:

- Build prototypes using your real, production-ready components
- Skip the branches, PRs, and deployments—just compose visually
- Launch, validate, iterate, or scrap it, all without engineering bottlenecks

This makes Composify perfect for:

- Growth experiments
- Internal tools
- MVPs that need fast feedback from real users

Some teams even treat their SDUI-powered surfaces as "live prototypes." They test and tune layouts continuously, then "lock them in" once an experiment is validated.
