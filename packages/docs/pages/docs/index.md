# Introduction [What is Composify?]

Composify is an open-source toolkit that lets you build pages visually, using your own production components.

Think of it as a WYSIWYG editor that's powered by your component library, not some generic widget set.

You build components once, and Composify empowers anyone on your team—from marketing to product—to visually compose pages with them. The result is faster iteration, fewer developer bottlenecks, and a massive productivity boost for everyone.

Under the hood, Composify takes a plain JSX string and renders it exactly as React would. What you see in the editor is exactly what you get in production. No rewrites, no custom syntax, no complex APIs.
