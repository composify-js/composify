# A/B testing and prototyping

A/B testing isn't just about changing button colors anymore. With Composify, you can test entirely different UI variations, without touching client code.

You might want to try:

- Switching between completely different page structures
- Showing or hiding modules (e.g. a referral banner for active users only)
- Testing different CTAs, images, or copy based on user segments
- Personalizing onboarding flows based on user behavior

You can configure all of this from your backend. Assign layouts based on experiment groups, manage variants via feature flags, and analyze performance â€” no redeploys needed.

This also unlocks another powerful use case: lightweight prototyping. Say you have an idea for a new upsell screen, a referral flow, or a product announcement. You want to test it in the real app, not in Figma.

With Composify:

- Build the prototype using actual components
- No new branches or deployments. Just compose visually
- Launch, validate, iterate, or discard. All without engineering bottlenecks

This makes Composify especially useful for:

- Growth experiments
- Internal tools
- MVPs that need fast feedback from real users

Some teams even treat SDUI surfaces as live prototypes. They test and tune layouts continuously, then "lock them in" once they're validated.
