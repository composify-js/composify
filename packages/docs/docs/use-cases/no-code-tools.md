# No code tools

Not every UI change comes from the product team. Marketing needs to launch new promotions. Content editors want to tweak a landing page. Ops teams want to run localized campaigns or seasonal themes.

With Composify, they can:

- Build campaign pages from pre-defined blocks
- Edit text, images, and layout visually, without code
- Ship changes instantly, without waiting for a developer

This works especially well for:

- Promotional or campaign landing pages
- Regional or seasonal content
- Blog-like longform layouts powered by real components

Instead of building custom CMSs or burning engineering time on small changes, you can let other teams ship on their own â€” using the same components, design system, and visual editor as the rest of the product.
