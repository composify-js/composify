# Design Systems

Design tools are great. But they often diverge from what's actually implemented.

With Composify, the canvas _is_ your design system. Designers don't work with abstract components or static mockups. They work with the exact components used in production.

This means:

- Zero ambiguity between design and development
- Enforced consistencyâ€”if it's not in the system, it can't be used
- Creative freedom within clear boundaries

And when something new is needed? Designers may request a component, and once engineers ship it, it's instantly available in the editor.

It's not just a visual tool. It's a governed playground built on top of your actual UI stack. Design with your real design system.
