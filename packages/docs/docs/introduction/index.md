# Introduction

Welcome to Composify ðŸ‘‹

## What is Composify?

Composify is an open-source Server-Driven UI (SDUI) library that brings together two powerful pieces: a lightweight JSX renderer and a visual editor that runs on _your_ actual components.

In simple terms: it's a WYSIWYG editor â€” but instead of some abstract component system, it uses your real codebase.

You build components, and Composify lets anyone on your team visually compose pages with them. That means faster iteration, fewer bottlenecks, and a massive productivity boost for everyone.

Under the hood, it takes plain JSX strings and turns them into real, working UI. No custom DSLs, no reinventing your stack.
