# A/B Testing and Prototyping [Prototype and iterate faster]

A/B testing is more than changing button colors. With Composify, you can test entirely different UI variations without touching client-side code.

For example:

- Swap out entire page structures for different user segments
- Show or hide modules (e.g., a referral banner for active users only)
- Test different CTAs, images, or copy
- Personalize onboarding flows based on user behavior

All of this lives on your backend. Assign layouts to experiment groups, gate them with feature flags, track performance. No redeploy needed.

Composify also makes prototyping fast. Have an idea for a new feature? Test it in the real app, not just in Figma.

- Build prototypes with your real, production-ready components
- Skip the branches, PRs, and deployments
- Launch, validate, iterate, or scrap it without engineering bottlenecks

Great for growth experiments, internal tools, and MVPs that need fast feedback from real users.

Some teams treat their SDUI-powered surfaces as "live prototypes." They test and tune layouts continuously, then lock them in once an experiment is validated.
