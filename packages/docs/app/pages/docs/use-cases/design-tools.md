# Design Tools [A design tool that's always in sync]

Design tools are great, but they have a classic problem: they drift out of sync with production.

With Composify, your design canvas *is* your production code. Designers don't work with static mockups or lookalike components. They build with the exact same components your users see.

- **Zero drift** between design and development
- **Guaranteed consistency**: if a component isn't in the system, it can't be used
- **Creative freedom** within clear, established boundaries

Need a new component? Designers request it, engineers build and register it, and it's instantly available in the editor.

Composify isn't just another visual tool. It's a playground built on your actual UI stack, with guardrails. Stop designing with replicas. **Start designing with the real thing.**
