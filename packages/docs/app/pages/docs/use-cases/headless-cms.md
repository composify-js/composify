# Headless CMS [Use your own components, not templates]

Traditional CMSs like WordPress are powerful, but they lock you into their ecosystem of themes and plugins. Your components can't be used, so you end up rebuilding UIs with clunky page builders or outdated templates.

With Composify, your own component library is at the center of the content experience. The visual editor runs on your actual production components, not some restrictive theme.

- Use the same components for marketing pages as you do for your core product
- Let content and marketing teams build visually, without being limited by pre-made templates
- What you edit is exactly what ships. No gap between your CMS and your production app.

It's CMS flexibility with the power and consistency of your own design system. Stop rebuilding. Start composing.
